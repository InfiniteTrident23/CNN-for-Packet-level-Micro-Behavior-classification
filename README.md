# CNN-for-Packet-level-Micro-Behavior-classification
This project uses CNNs to classify network packets as Tor, VPN, or regular traffic by treating packet metadata as image-like input. This approach enables accurate, real-time detection of anonymized traffic, enhancing network security, intrusion detection, and monitoring.
